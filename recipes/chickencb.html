    <h3>Recipie Summary</h3>
    <p>A cordon bleu is a dish that traditionally consists of meat wrapped around cheese, then breaded<br>
    and pan-fried or deep-fried. Many modern versions of the classic French recipe, such as this one,<br>
    are baked.<br>
    Classic chicken cordon bleu is made with the following ingredients:<br>
    chicken cutlets, cooked ham, Swiss cheese, bread crumbs, and simple spices.<br>
    It's usually topped with a rich cream sauce spiked with a hint of Dijon mustard. <br>
    "Cordon bleu" translates to "blue ribbon." According to Larousse Gastronomique, a French food encyclopedia,<br>
    the phrase dates back to medieval times when the most prestigious order a knight could earn was called the<br>
    Cross of the Holy Spirit. The honor was signified by a medal that hung from a blue ribbon known as<br>
    Le Cordon Bleu. Over time, the blue ribbon became a symbol of excellence.<br>
    The term, meanwhile, became associated with food that meets the highest of standards<br>
    or that is prepared by the most prestigious chefs.</p>
